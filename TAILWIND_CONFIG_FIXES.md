# Tailwind CSS Configuration Updates

This document explains the changes made to fix the Tailwind CSS configuration for Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Issue

The original configuration was using a custom implementation of `@tailwindcss/postcss` package with version `0.1.1`, which doesn't exist in the npm registry. When deploying to Cloudflare Pages, the build process was failing with the error:

```
ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION  No matching version found for @tailwindcss/postcss@^0.1.1
```

## Solution

The configuration has been updated to use the official `@tailwindcss/postcss` package with version `4.0.16`, which is available in the npm registry.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed `"@tailwindcss/postcss": "^0.1.1"` to `"@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.16"`

2. **Updated tailwind.config.ts**:
   - Changed `plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/postcss/plugin")]` to `plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")]`
   - This directly uses the tailwindcss-animate plugin instead of going through our custom adapter

3. **Kept postcss.config.mjs**:
   - The configuration using `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}` is correct for the official package

4. **Removed custom implementation**:
   - Removed the custom implementation of `@tailwindcss/postcss` from the `node_modules` directory

## Why This Works

The official `@tailwindcss/postcss` package (version 4.0.16) is designed to work with Tailwind CSS 4.0.15 and provides the necessary PostCSS plugin functionality. By using the official package instead of our custom implementation, we ensure compatibility with the npm ecosystem and avoid deployment issues.

The `tailwindcss-animate` plugin is now directly referenced in the Tailwind configuration, which simplifies the setup and removes the dependency on our custom adapter.

## Testing

This configuration has been tested to ensure it works correctly with Tailwind CSS 4.0.15 and the official `@tailwindcss/postcss` package version 4.0.16.
